# Ortex Alerts
A Chrome extension that enhances Ortex's options flow to alert users when mass volume is purchased from market makers, hedge funds, and other big-money players. 

**Note:** Ortex's options flow displays trades made by market makers, hedge funds, and other big-money players. 

Usually, when mass volume is purchased and displayed on Ortex, it often indicates that a ticker may *(not guaranteed)* move in a certain direction. In my experience (**not** financial advice) of viewing the stock market and testing, most of the time (if no unorthodox news comes up), a ticker will head in the direction that the mass volume displays. For instance, if millions of AAPL *calls* are purchased for an expiration two weeks out by market makers, it could suggest that something significant is coming. *This is not guaranteed. It doesn’t happen every time, but more often than not, the flow direction aligns with the stock movement.*

**THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH BEFORE CONDUCTING TRADES.**
